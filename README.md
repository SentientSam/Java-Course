# Java-Course
This is a repository I am using to store my programs as I learn Java. When finished it will have everything from base introductions to full applications.

To start off I am using the NetBeans IDE 11.3 with JDK 14 as my development enviroment.
1. NetBeans - https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html
2. JDK - https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html#JDK14

You an go to https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/ to see the latest versions of NetBeand and JDK if you wish to use those (all the code should still work)

**Saluton.java:** This file is my "Hello World!" traditional introduction. The only real difference is I output the string in Danish. It shows how to initialize most of the .java files I will be using and some basics of variable assignment / output.

**Root.java:** This file takes the value of a variable of type integer named "number" and calculates the square root. It then posts the result.

**BlankFiller.java:** This file will take any 3 arguments and apply them to the statement "The __ __ fox jumped over the __ dog."

The big thing with this application is that you have to assign the arguments within the properties of the project with NetBeans.
To do this you can go to: Run -> *Set Project Configuration -> Customize... -> Run*

Here you will see a box named **Main Class:** where you will put the class name (in this case, BlankFiller). Where it says Arguments you write the three arguments that you want applied to the sentace, seperated by a space.
