# Java-Course
This is a repository I am using to store my programs as I learn Java. When finished it will have everything from base introductions to full applications.

To start off I am using the NetBeans IDE 11.3 with JDK 14 as my development enviroment.
1. NetBeans - https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html
2. JDK - https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html#JDK14

You an go to https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/ to see the latest versions of NetBeand and JDK if you wish to use those (all the code should still work)

**Saluton.java:** This file is my "Hello World!" traditional introduction. The only real difference is I output the string in Danish. It shows how to initialize most of the .java files I will be using and some basics of variable assignment / output.
