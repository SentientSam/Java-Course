# Java-Course
This is a repository I am using to store my programs as I learn Java. When finished it will have everything from base introductions to full applications.

To start off I am using the NetBeans IDE 8.2 RC with JDK 8 as my development enviroment.
1. NetBeans - https://netbeans.org/downloads/8.2/rc/
2. JDK - https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html

JDK 8 should be installed first if you are installing these files seperately. There are packages that will download both of these simultaneously for you though if you prefer.

**Saluton.java:** This file is my "Hello World!" traditional introduction. The only real difference is I output the string in Danish. It shows how to initialize most of the .java files I will be using and some basics of variable assignment / output.
